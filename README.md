Simple to-do lists are great for keeping track of tasks you need to accomplish. But if you’re working with a team where tasks have sub-tasks that have sub-sub-tasks and more, that’s where you especially need a project management software. Project management apps, even simple ones like Trello, can break your project down into achievable steps and give your team a more manageable workflow.
